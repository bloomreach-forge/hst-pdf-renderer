      <h2>Solar power: the sky is the limit (Externally Publshed)</h2>
    <p>Feb 10, 2011</p>
    <p>This week’s record-breaking night flight by the Solar Impulse aircraft has been widely acclaimed, but few of us are ever likely to fly in such a plane.</p>
    

<p>Swiss adventurer Bertrand Piccard, the initiator of the project, pilot André
Borschberg, and the host of designers and developers who made the flight
possible may have entered the history books, but what does their achievement
mean in practical terms?</p>

<p>“I hope that in two years time at the next Green Aviation Show we shall be
able to give a prize to the hero of the day, Bertrand Piccard,” Gerard Feldzer,
director of the Air and Space Museum at Paris’ Le Bourget airport, told
swissinfo.ch <br/>
Feldzer, who has known Piccard for many years, is an expert on
environmentally-friendly aircraft. He points out though that Solar Impulse is
not the first plane of its type. <br/>
The Green Aviation Show awarded for example its 2010 prize to Eric Raymond – who
first crossed the United States in <br/>
a solar-powered plane 20 years ago. <br/>
The difference was that Raymond made his flight in one-hour hops, Feldzer
explained.</p>

<p><strong>Twice the size, ten times the problems</strong></p>

<p>“The technique is no different, but Piccard’s achievement is to build a big
enough plane. When you double the size, that doesn’t mean you have twice the
number of problems. You have ten times the problems.” <br/>
On the one hand the structural challenge is much more complex – supporting the
giant wing, and transmitting and storing the energy, for example. <br/>
But a long flight is a human challenge too. <br/>
“You have to be able sit still, take tiny snatches of sleep… It’s like a space
flight, or even worse. You can’t move… Everything has to be within reach.”
<br/>
It would have been possible to fly a solar-powered drone across the Atlantic
long ago, Feldzer explained; having a person on board “changes everything”.</p>
