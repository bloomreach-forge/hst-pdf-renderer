# HST PDF Renderer

**HST PDF Renderer** basically transforms HTML output into PDF output.
It leverages [Flying Saucer](http://code.google.com/p/flying-saucer/) library to generate PDF output.
Because Flying Saucer requires valid XHTML input for PDF generation,
**HST PDF Renderer** supports transformation from HTML markups to valid XHTML markups 
by leveraging [JTidy](http://jtidy.sourceforge.net) library.
HST PDF Renderer also supports a servlet filter which transforms normal HTML output to PDF output at runtime.
